# AngularStarter

Start
- ng-serve (should run on localhost4200)

Navigation
- localhost/renderer is where manipulatives are rendered. 

Editing
- The "container" class is where you can test your manipulative components when you're ready. Currently it contains the spotlight but you can replace that with whatever you want.
